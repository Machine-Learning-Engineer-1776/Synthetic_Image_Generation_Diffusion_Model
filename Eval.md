<u>**Synthetic Image Generation Evaluation**</u>

This section presents the evaluation results for our synthetic image generation project, which successfully developed an AI model to generate realistic brain MRI scans using advanced generative techniques, including a Stable Diffusion pipeline. The model’s performance was rigorously assessed using quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and FID) and qualitative manual scoring, demonstrating its ability to produce high-fidelity brain scans distinguishable from random shapes. These results highlight the project’s potential for applications in medical imaging and CRISPR-driven DNA visualization, showcasing proficiency in generative AI and bioinformatics.

This is the Photo Evaluation?   Can you pick the image from the working model?

The above image showcases a synthetic brain MRI scan generated by our final **Stable Diffusion model** (50 batches, 1000 timesteps, guidance scale 7.0), validated by mentors as visually indistinguishable from real scans. This qualitative evaluation confirms the model’s ability to capture intricate brain structures, supporting its applicability in biotech imaging tasks.

The above chart illustrates the **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** scores computed post-training for our generated brain scans compared to a reference dataset of real MRIs. Despite initial FID computation challenges due to Colab memory constraints (resolved by disabling real-time FID generation), the final model achieved competitive FID scores, indicating strong distributional similarity to real brain scans and reinforcing the model’s generative quality.

The above visualization summarizes additional evaluation metrics, including **Structural Similarity Index** (SSIM: 0.4526), **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio** (PSNR: 14.9781), and **Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity** (LPIPS: ~0.1), alongside a manual score of 5/5 for the Stable Diffusion model. These metrics, combined with mentor-validated visual clarity, demonstrate the model’s superior performance over earlier VAE, DCGAN, and U-Net GAN iterations, positioning it as a robust tool for medical imaging applications in precision medicine.
