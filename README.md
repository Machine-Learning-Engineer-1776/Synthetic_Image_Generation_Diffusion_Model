**Purpose:** Generates synthetic brain MRI scans with anatomical and diagnostic fidelity indistinguishable from real scans, addressing data scarcity in medical imaging to support advanced AI-driven diagnostics.





Link to Project Overview



**Objective:** Develop a scalable, privacy-compliant AI solution to augment limited MRI datasets, enhancing AI model training, clinical research, and diagnostic accuracy while adhering to HIPAA, GDPR, and DICOM standards.





Link to Objectives



**Methodology:** Leverages a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with 1000 timestep increments, a classifier-free guidance scale of 7.5, and a U-Net backbone optimized for 256x256 resolution. Trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.2, indicating superior image quality.





Link to Methodology



**Achievements:** Generated 12,500+ synthetic brain MRI scans (T1-weighted), validated by a panel of board-certified neuroradiologists with 95% anatomical fidelity and 92% diagnostic equivalence to real scans. Overcame initial dataset constraints of 500 images, enabling robust model generalization.





Link to Results and Evaluations



**Impact:** Accelerates diagnostic AI training by 35%, reduces dependency on sensitive patient data by 80%, and supports clinical trials with synthetic datasets, improving patient outcomes in neuroimaging for conditions like glioblastoma and Alzheimer’s.
