**Purpose:** Generates synthetic brain MRI scans that mirror real scans in anatomical and diagnostic detail, addressing data scarcity in medical imaging.





Link to Project Overview



**Objective:** Develop a scalable AI-driven solution to augment limited MRI datasets, enhancing AI training, clinical research, and diagnostics while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and GDPR privacy standards.





Link to Objectives



**Methodology:** Employs a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with 1000 timestep increments and a classifier-free guidance scale of 7.5, transforming Gaussian noise into high-resolution (256x256) synthetic MRI images.





Link to Methodology



**Achievements:** Produced 10,000+ synthetic brain MRI scans, validated by neuroradiologists with 95% anatomical fidelity compared to real scans, overcoming initial dataset limitations of 500 images.





Link to Results and Evaluations



Impact: Enables 30% faster training of diagnostic AI models and reduces reliance on sensitive patient data, improving patient outcomes in neuroimaging applications.
